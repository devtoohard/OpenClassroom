YHU2269,Ethics and Politics of Sex,Philosophy,PPE,,,,,"In this course we consider the moral and political dimensions of sex understood as individual and social practice. Are sexual preferences, fantasies, behaviors, and traditions morally criticisable, and if so, how? What about sexual industries and institutions? In what ways do our sexual practices impede or advance present-day struggles for social equality?"
YHU2270,Contemporary Egalitarianism,Philosophy,PPE,,,,,"Is it unjust for a society to be unequal? If equality is desirable, what kind of equality? Equality of opportunity? Or equal welfare? Or equal capabilities? Contemporary political philosophy offers rich materials to answer these questions; we will read authors such as Rawls, Nozick, Cohen, Sen, and Anderson. The course satisfies the following dimensions of the Philosophy major: Skills, problems; Historical, new."
YHU2288,Queer Fictions,Literature,,,,,,"This course focuses on twentieth-century narratives that explore sexuality and gender issues in their socio-historical contexts. It examines adolescent attachments, sororal and brotherly love, friendship, etc., and how these relations tip over to homosociality and eroticism. As an introductory course, it familiarises students with debates on sexual identities and politics through analyses of fictional works from the US, UK, and Asia, offering a vocabulary for queer experience and perspectives that illuminate queer interiority and same-sex relations. Overall, the course reflects on and challenges fictions and critical approaches that are essentially ""queer."""
YHU2289,Ensemble Practice 1,Arts and Humanities,,,,,,"Performing in an ensemble is a powerfully integrative social activity. As a collective, ensembles consider ways in which to coordinate the synchrony/complementarity of actions performed by two or more individuals. Coordinating this synergy requires the exchange of information among individuals to facilitate understanding and prediction of others' intentions. This course will create musical dialogues, in any musical style, amongst vocal and instrumental performers and these combinations will be decided within the class group only. The skills in this course are designed to develop and refine ensemble cohesion and will encompass concepts such as deep listening, harmonization and improvisation."
YHU2290,History and Culture of Southeast Asia,History,,,,,,"This course will examine Southeast Asia from a historical and anthropological perspective. We will explore such questions as: can we speak of a “Southeast Asian” history and culture, or is Southeast Asia a product of external influences? How have colonialism and the nationality shaped Southeast Asia? What is the role of Buddhism, Islam, and Catholicism in Southeast Asian cultures? This course will not only chart the past (and future) of the region, but also apply the insights that we gain from studying Southeast Asia to how we understand the rest of the world."
YHU3205,Ming Imperial Voyages,History,,,,Historical Immersion,,"From 1405 to 1433, the Ming admiral Zheng He (Cheng Ho) led seven extravagant expeditions to kingdoms in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean world, going as far as the African continent.

YHU3221,Nietzsche: An Untimely Thinker and His Times,History,Philosophy,,,Historical Immersion,,"In the 1880s, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and called for a new life-affirming philosophy to combat the rise of nihilism. Nietzsche, one of the most provocative thinkers of the nineteenth century, lived in an age of cultural tumult and intellectual transformation. This course provides a window into this period through a close engagement with Nietzsche’s writings, including his philosophical works, his personal correspondence, and his autobiography. Attention will also be paid to his friendship and subsequent disillusionment with the composer Richard Wagner."
YHU3223,The Self in Comparative Perspective,Philosophy,Global Antiquity,History,,,,"This course examines the notions of self and person, what it is to be an ‘I’, in a comparative philosophical context, drawing on key textual sources in translation, and comparing them to modern representations of the self. The course will raise questions about what are distinctive conceptualizations of self or person in traditional Hinduism and Christianity and how these differ from modern understandings, including distinct expectations regarding social role, gender, and anticipation of a future life. The course raises questions about what ways of thinking are shared and not shared between cultures and about hopes and expectations through the centuries."
YHU4238,The Female Image in Japanese Art and Literature,Arts and Humanities,Literature,,,,,"The course will examine the production, reception and interpretation of the female imagery and representation of gender roles for Japanese women through visual images and literary texts from the 11th to the 20th century, with an emphasis towards the modern period. The female image occupies a crucial part in understanding key historical and cultural developments in Japan, such as how the evolving influences of Westernization and modernity began to characterize Japanese society during the early decades of the 20th century. Students will analyse a wide range of materials from 11th century novel to literary pieces by renowned modern authors."
YHU3243,"Woolf, Historiography, and the Scene of the Modern",Literature,,,,Historical Immersion,,"Woolf lived in an era of tremendous historical-mindedness in which artists, writers, and historians were deeply engaged with how the past should be represented. Students will explore Woolf’s engagement in this debate through close analysis of her diaries, drafts, and published works as well as primary source materials (museum artifacts and contemporary newspapers) that help place her engagement in the social, cultural, and political issues of the early twentieth century. Was this engagement with the past at odds with a liberal belief in progress, or was the past, for Woolf, a causal entity to be interpreted for its historical difference?"
YHU3267,Classical Indian Philosophy of Language,Philosophy,PPE,Global Antiquity,,,,"Classical Indian Philosophy introduces students to major topics in linguistic analysis within the traditions of India. This course focuses on two questions: What is linguistic meaning? How do we understand what is meant? As the former question is embedded within the latter for Indian thinkers, the first third of the course will be spent on epistemology of testimony in Nyaya and Mima¿sa. The middle third of the course takes up the question of what meaning(s) are primary, both in terms of words and sentences.

Students will analyse and discuss Kuo’s portrayal of war-time experience with reference to materials they have gathered. In addition, students will create a short performance/creative work from these materials."
YHU3287,"Early Global Literatures and the World, 500-1500 CE",Literature,Global Affairs,History,Global Antiquity,,,"World systems theorists have formulated models of an economically interlinked world from the early modern period on, but the globalism of an earlier, premodern period of roughly a thousand years, 500-1500 CE—also known as the “Middle Ages”—is still insufficiently understood. World systems, moreover, emphasize the economic at the expense of the sociocultural. To sustain the social and cultural analysis of early globalisms, “Early Global Literatures and the World, 500-1500 CE”—a transhumanities course—closely examines human interactions across the planet in the longue durée through the focus of key literary-historical global texts."
YHU3288,Installation Art,Arts and Humanities,Environmental Studies,,,,,"The course will give students the opportunity to engage with space and place from a creative perspective.

Students will draw upon basic visual media while learning to utilize new media, natural materials, sculpture, video and other media. The aim of this course is to develop one’s own language for expression that is sensitive to space."
YHU3289,"Beyond China: Sinophone Literature, Film, and Culture",Literature,Chinese Studies,,,,,"“China” and “Chinese” are no longer adequate terms for the study of Sinitic-language communities and cultures that evince politically tenuous and linguistically polyphonic relations with the People’s Republic of China. This course interrogates Sinophone Studies as a critical, interdisciplinary alternative to previous constructions of Chinese literature and culture tied to the nation-state and progressive narratives of modernity. Students will study fiction and films from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States, and the PRC, along with critical works explaining the ways that diaspora, colonialism, comparative empires, and ethnic or minority studies have informed the rise of Sinophone Studies. All Chinese-language materials will be read in English translation."
YHU3290,Dante's Divine Comedy,Literature,Global Antiquity,,,,,"This course is a slow and philological reading Dante’s Divine Comedy, an undisputed masterwork of world literature. As the Italian poet narrates his vision of the world beyond, we will journey with him through Hell to Purgatory and ascend to Paradise and finally return to earth. We will pay special attention to the historical, intellectual and social world of the European Middle Ages and the fraught legacy of the classical tradition. Based on student interest, we might work on volume 2 of the Dante Journal of Singapore, highlighting the original research of the seminar participants."
YHU3291,"Sacrifice, Sex, and Power in Medieval Kashmir",Global Antiquity,,,,Historical Immersion,,"Kashmir became an important centre of philosophy, religion and literature in the early medieval period (850-1050), with Buddhism and different kinds of Hinduism vying with each other for royal patronage. Orthodox Brahmins performed sacrifice and practiced ritual purity, Buddhism cultivated inner purity of the mind that leads to salvation (nirva¿a), while new forms of Hinduism called Tantra rejected ritual purity in the belief that impurity – such as ritual sex outside caste – leads to power and success. This course will examine these concerns by focusing on a play, Much Ado About Religion, and a philosophical text, The Essence of Supreme Truth."

YHU4204,Rise of the West and the Great Divergence,History,Anthropology,Global Affairs,Chinese Studies,,,"Why did Europe rise and China fall? Why did Europe achieve long-term sustained economic growth (the industrial revolution) in the eighteenth century, while China - perhaps the world’s most politically and technologically advanced empire at the time - declined dramatically? Why was Japan the only empire in Asia to catch up with Europe in the nineteenth century? We will attempt to answer these questions by examining the histories of Britain, Europe, China, India and Japan and by reading the major debates in economic history and sociology on the ‘rise of the west’ and the ‘great divergence.’"
YHU4206,The History of History,History,,,,Major Requirement,,"Practitioners of every discipline benefit from having an understanding of their discipline’s history. This is especially true for historians, whose work demands an acquaintance with the history of the writing practices and the modes of conceptualizing the past to which they are heirs. Through an engagement with foundational texts from the eighteenth century to the present, this course explores the emergence and development of modern historiography. Students will learn about the diverse ways in which the past has been represented, narrated, and interpreted; they will also examine how historians’ interpretations of the past are themselves imbedded in specific historical contexts."
YHU4234,"Trauma, Loss, Exile and the Literary Imagination",Literature,,,,,,"Since the colonial conquests of the 19th century that characterised the Arab world’s modern encounter with Europe, the region has been marked by a collective sense of trauma and loss, something that has continued into the 21st century. This course will explore the effects multiple foreign occupations, post-independence authoritarian regimes, and forced displacements have wrought on the literary and cultural production of the Middle East and North Africa.

We will look at five crisis moments in European history and how the continent recovered from them, including the crisis of the First and Second World Wars, the Great Depression, 1989, and the current economic and migration crises."
YHU4236,New Media: Inquiries into Literature & Technology,Literature,,,,,,"No more adding of “new media”, media scholars have cried out over the recent years, to existing things when what we call “old media” was to quip a seminal phrasing, always already new. The same can be said for the communities and publics that media helped form. As ‘new media’ becomes increasingly ubiquitous in popular and scholarly discourse, we have lost sight of the term’s older origin as the mediation between cultures, politics, identities, and ideologies. Through media theory, literary narratives, films, and artworks, students will learn the post-hermeneutic turn in the humanities, where the idea of “text” is simply one of the dynamic effects of mediality."
YHU4237,Chinese Prose,Literature,Global Antiquity,Chinese Studies,,,,"This class will examine the Chinese prose (sanwen) tradition as it evolved from early historiographical and philosophical works of the Eastern Zhou through the collections of literary masters from the Tang, Song, and later imperial China.

The final project asks students to analyse an ongoing movement in detail and recommend effective strategies for increasing global sustainability."
YID3214,Urban Ecological Systems,Environmental Sciences,,,,,,"With an increasingly urbanised human population the interaction of nature with the built environment and its human inhabitants is emerging as one of the greatest sources of both opportunity and inertia to goals of sustainability. In this course you will consider the extent to which urbanisation has changed natural ecosystems and led to the rise of a new urban ecology, and consider how humans can value and manage this in a socio-ecological context. We will then address how the confluence of climate change, globalisation and urbanisation are fundamentally altering our living space and the implications for human health and wellness."
